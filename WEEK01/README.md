# Week 01 Activity (`Activity1.py`)

This script uses NumPy to analyze weekly temperature data (in Celsius).

**Operations Performed:**
1.  Calculates and prints the average temperature using `np.mean()`.
2.  Finds and prints the highest (`np.max()`) and lowest (`np.min()`) temperatures.
3.  Converts all Celsius temperatures to Fahrenheit using vectorized arithmetic (`* 9/5 + 32`).
4.  Identifies the indices of days where the temperature was above 20Â°C using `np.where()`.

**Concepts Demonstrated:**
*   Creating NumPy arrays (`np.array()`).
*   Basic statistical functions (`np.mean`, `np.max`, `np.min`).
*   Vectorized arithmetic operations for unit conversion.
*   Conditional selection using `np.where()` to find indices meeting a criterion.
